				<h2>Explore every feature.</h2>
				<p>When Sketch 3 is released in a few weeks it will come packed with dozens of features including symbols, art boards, grouping, masking and transforms. Sketch Hero goes into each one of them, explaining how they work and providing useful examples.</p>

				<h2>Resource files + eBook</h2>
				<p>We'll go through each feature with a clear and detailed explanation and back it up with use-cases and interviews. And because nothing beats practice, you'll get .sketch files to explore each feature and how it could fit into your workflow.</p>
